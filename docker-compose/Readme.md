### Setup

#### OpenID4VP config

The configuration file can be found under `config` directory.

**Example Configuration Explanation**

Let's look at the "MOSIP ID" example to understand how these properties work together:

```json
{
  "logo": "/assets/cert.png",
  "name": "MOSIP ID",
  "type": "MOSIPVerifiableCredential",
  "essential": true,
  "definition": {
    "purpose": "Relying party is requesting your digital ID for the purpose of Self-Authentication",
    "format": {
      "ldp_vc": {
        "proof_type": [
          "RsaSignature2018"
        ]
      }
    },
    "input_descriptors": [
      {
        "id": "id card credential",
        "format": {
          "ldp_vc": {
            "proof_type": [
              "RsaSignature2018"
            ]
          }
        },
        "constraints": {
          "fields": [
            {
              "path": [
                "$.type"
              ],
              "filter": {
                "type": "object",
                "pattern": "MOSIPVerifiableCredential"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`logo`: The image /assets/cert.png will be shown on the credential selection panel.

`name`: The name that has to be shown on the credential selection panel.

`type`: Internally, this configuration is used to identify what are the different types of credential.

`essential`: This credential is required for the verification to succeed.
`definition` : The presentation definition for the particular type of credential. For more details check [[DIF.PresentationExchange]](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/spec/v2.0.0/)

### Run Using Docker Compose:

Navigate to the docker-compose directory:

```shell
cd docker-compose
```

> Make sure ports 3000, 8080, and 5432 are free.

Run the following command to build and start all services:

```shell
docker-compose up -d # if docker compose is installed as a standalone command.
docker compose up -d # if docker compose is installed as a plugin to docker command
```

This will start:

* verify-service (backend)
* verify-ui (frontend)
* postgres (database)

The UI will be accessible at: http://localhost:3000

API (verify-service) swagger runs at: http://localhost:8080/v1/verify/swagger-ui/index.html

To stop the application, run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose down # if docker compose is installed as a standalone command.
docker compose down # if docker compose is installed as a plugin to docker command
```

To remove volumes as well (clean reset):

```shell
docker-compose down -v # if docker compose is installed as a standalone command.
docker compose down -v # if docker compose is installed as a plugin to docker command
```

### Troubleshooting

To check container logs:

```shell
docker-compose logs -f
```
