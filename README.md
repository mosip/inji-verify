# Developer Setup:

Once the repo is cloned, move into the inji-verify repository folder and run the following command to check out to the develop branch:

```shell
cd inji-verify # move into the repository folder
git checkout develop
```

### Development server:

To get a development server up and running, run the following commands:

```shell
mvn clean
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Run Docker Image:

(Note: Make sure that the following commands are run in the directory where Dockerfile is present)

Run the following commands to build and test the application as docker images

```shell
mvn -U -B package
docker build -t <dockerImageName>:<tag> .
docker run -it -d -p 3000:8000 --env-file ./.env --name inji-verify-service-dev <dockerImageName>:<tag>
```

Inji verify backend is designed to run in local with in memory H2 DB also we have another spring profile to do same. This can
be controlled by passing `active_profile_env` environment variable while building the docker image

```shell
mvn -U -B package
docker build --build-arg active_profile=local -t <dockerImageName>:<tag> .
docker run -it -d -p 3000:8000 --env-file ./.env --name inji-verify-service-dev <dockerImageName>:<tag>
```

To build the Docker image locally, use the following command. Ensure you are in the directory containing the Dockerfile:

```shell
docker build -t inji-verify-service:local
```

Stop and delete the docker containers using the following commands:

```shell
docker stop inji-verify-service-dev
docker rm inji-verify-service-dev
```

# Demo Setup:

This section helps to quickly get started with a demo of the Inji Verify application

Once the repository is cloned, move into the inji-verify repository directory.

```shell
cd ./inji-verify # repository folder
git checkout branchName/tagname
```
